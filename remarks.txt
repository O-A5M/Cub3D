    ##Othman's part:
    ---------------
        ###1 Parsing doesn't exit when the player is not found on the map!
        ###2 Parsing an empty map: correctly handled but outputs "cub3d: Success on the screen"!
        ###3 If we change `int array[3]` to `char array[3]`, we'd have to be careful about error checking.
                probably have to check if the ft_atoi() return is bigger than 255, before assiginig it to
                `array[index]` because with `char` type it will be typecasted, changing its value and causing issues.
                so the condition:
                        `if (param->ceiling_color[i] < 0 || param->ceiling_color[i] > 255
			            || param->floor_color[i] < 0 || param->floor_color[i] > 255)`
                will not be valid anymore.

    ##Obito's part:
    ------------
        ###1 Memory is not freed when mlx initialization fails!
        ###2 Handle angles where dist_per_x and dist_per_y tend to INF, just hardcode DOUBLE_MAX or DOUBLE_MIN for those.
        ###3 Will need to test the case where the ray is diagonal, like `angle = 45deg` for example,
                as both the cells, cell_y and cell_x will be incremented.

    ##Othman's part:
    ---------------
        ###1 Use of static for params, why? It feels unnecessary.
        ###2 Is rayclude.h needed anymore? If not we just delete it and its calls.
        ###3 

    ##Obito's part:
    ------------
        ###1 Unnecessary declaration of unused stuctures in the header file.
        ###2 Change render.c 's name to ray_caster.c or something similar.
        ###3 Pass just `img` pointer instead of `params` pointer for functions like draw_celing_and_floor()
